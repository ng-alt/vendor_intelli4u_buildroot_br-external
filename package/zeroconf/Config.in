	  which can be used for ad-hoc neworks. Addresses are allocated from the
	  169.254.0.0/16 range semi-randomly. That menas making it possible to
	  take two laptop computers, and connect them with a crossover Ethernet
	  cable, and have them communicate usefully using IP, without needing
	  any additional setup.
