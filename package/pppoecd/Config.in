	  PPPoE is a technique for the encapsulation of PPP streams inside of
	  Ethernet frames. The technology is being deployed by high-speed Internet
	  access providers (cable modems, xDSL, etc.) in order to decouple the
	  supply of bandwidth from ISP services.

	  Further details on PPPoE can be found in RFC2516.
