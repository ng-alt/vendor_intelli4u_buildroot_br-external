	  l2tpd is an implementation of the layer two tunneling protocol. It works
	  in user space completely (althought kernel work is planned after the
	  userspace version is stablized). l2tpd works by opening a pseudo-tty for
	  communcating with pppd. Although 2tpd was written for Linux, the current
	  version should be highly portable to other UNIX's supported by pppd.
