	  Wake-on-LAN (WoL) is a standard that allows a user to send a packet over
	  the network to one or more computers that are off to turn those computers
	  on.

	  Some of home routers can send the packet from the router's configuration
	  page. Alternatively, WoL software utitilies can be used, or, online
	  websites exist that can send the package.
