	  ntpclient is an NTP (Network Time Protocol) RFC-1305 client for
	  unix-alike computers. Its functionality is a small subset of xntpd,
	  but IMHO performs better (or at least has the potential to function
	  better) with that limited scope. Since it is much smaller than xntpd,
	  it is also more relevant for embedded computers.
