	  bftpd is an FTP server for Linux, BSD/OS, FreeBSD, Solaris, DG-UX and
	  True64. It runs either with inetd or standalone.
	  
	  It tries to be very configurable while being fast and small. You can
	  make defaults for each configuration option, and then override these
	  defaults in user-specific and directory-specific structures.
