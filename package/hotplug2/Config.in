	  hotplug2 is aimed at early Linux user space, that is, initramfs or
	  initrd, possibly also at embedded devices (such as WRT-lik router) or
	  very weak machines, such as 386/486.

	  hotplug2 connects to the uevent netlink socket and read events. The
	  application generally operates in two modes, dumb and smart. And hotplug2
	  supports cold plugging simply by calling the 'udevtrigger' binary
	  internally. As udevtrigger is fairly independent on the reset of udev,
	  it can be easily embedded along with hotplug2.
