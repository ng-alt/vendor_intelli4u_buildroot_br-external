	  AVLTree is a small implementation of AVL trees for the C programming
	  language. It is distributed under the library GPL.

	  The library does the basic stuff. It allows for inserts, searches, and
	  deletes in O(log n) time. It also allows the tree to be used as a linked
	  indexable list (search/insert functions cannot be used in that case).
