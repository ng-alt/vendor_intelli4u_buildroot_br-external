	help
	  6relayd is a daemon for serving and relaying IPv6 management
	  protocols to configure clients and downstream routers. It tries
	  to follow the RFC6204 requirements for IPv6 home routers.

	  6relayd provides server services for RA, stateless and stateful
	  DHCPv6, prefix delegation and can be used to relay RA, DHCPv6
	  and NDP between routed (non-bridged) interfaces in case no
	  delegated prefixes are available.
