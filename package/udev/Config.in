      udev will be responsible for responding to /sbin/hotplug on device
      events. It will receive the device class information along with
      device's sysfs directory.
      
      udev will consist of a command udev - to be called from /sbin/hotplug.
      it will require the in memory dynamic database/table for keeping track
      of current system devices, and a library of routines for accessing that
      will be separated into the device naming subsystem. It's presented a
      common device naming API by the device naming subsystem to use for naming
      devices.
