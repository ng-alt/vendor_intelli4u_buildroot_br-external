	  Like all portmappers, this one is intended to be started at boot time.
	  Daemons that offer RPC services tell the portmapper on what port they
	  listen. Unlike the well-known services registered with the inetd, RPC
	  network port numbers may change each time the system is booted.
	  Whenever a client wants to use an RPC service it is supposed to first
	  ask the portmapper on what port the corresponding daemon is listening.
	  The rpcinfo command can tell you what RPC services your system offers.
	  
	  As described in the features section below, the replacement portmapper
	  can prevent undesirable client-server interactions.  In some cases,
	  better or equivalent alternatives are available:
	  
	      The SunOS portmap that is provided with patch id 100482-02 should
	      close the same security holes.  In addition, it provides an YPSERV
	      daemon with its own access control list. This is better than just
	      portmapper access control.
	  
	      The "securelib" shared library (eecs.nwu.edu:/pub/securelib.tar)
	      implements access control for all kinds of (RPC) services, not
	      just the portmapper.
	  
	  However, vendors still ship portmap implementations that allow anyone
	  to read or modify its tables and that will happily forward any request
	  so that it appears to come from the local system.
