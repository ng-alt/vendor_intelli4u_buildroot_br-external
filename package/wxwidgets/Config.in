	  wxWidgets is a C++ library that lets developers create applications
	  for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and other platforms with a signle code
	  base. It has popular language bindings for Python, Perl, Ruby and many
	  other languages, and unlike other cross-platform toolkits, wxWidgets
	  gives applications a truly native look and feel because it uses the
	  platform's native API rather than enulating the GUI.
